household, your mental health doesn’t really matters that much to your parents, I’m not saying that I don’t admire my parents no, I love them to the core of their being. They gave me everything that they could. It’s just that they’re generation is way different than mine(ours). So mentally every step I took was consciously 100% raken by me wether it was right or wrong. Don’t get the wrong idea I knew what was right and what was wrong while taking those steps. So the generational gap gave me the sight to see the world in a different way, I had to learn how to prescive things in a way in which I was in control of everything, fully conscious of taking a right or a wrong step and adult basically from a young age(not bragging). So I light my own path every day just like I’ve been doing for most of my past life. This may not be an open window for everybody, but to me…..it really is a bold way to fight through everything on your own and making the lives of the one’s you love better day by day.

This dream is lighting my path as a bioengineer and I focus on creating new technologies and advancing the medical sector. Currently I am working on a diabetes type 2 organ-on-chip research, the goal of which is to create a more relevant microbiological in vitro model of this disease.

I was a homeless kid with no skills or direction or a way to support my children and through hard work and luck. I am now a sous chef at uprise brewery In Spokane Washington. Hopefully I’ll be running my own restaurant one day. And I’ll be able to share the love ,passion and if I’m lucky pay forward to the youth of my city and teach them skills that can prevent them from going to prison or becoming addicted.

There isn't a moment that goes by in my life,  now that I'm a medically retired combat disabled USAF DV, where I'm engaging with music, dance and lighting. My whole house is set up on smart music  attenuated led lights and music visualization TV apps for when I play music which is all the time. I remember the first time I decided I wanted to be normal I was 6 years old. Lil did I know normal wasn't in the cards for me as an abused church cult member driven by fear and hope in the unknown I was able to break free once I was completely broken by the USAF SURVIVAL AND POW RESISTANCE TRAINING. Glad I made it through that because in Nov 2001 my aircraft was shot out of the sky and we landed behind enemy lines... it was then that I knew death was near... nope man do I have so much to live for and as a twin flame in this universe I'm one of the oldest souls with the mission of helping others through their life's journey. As I have gone through all of what life trauma and suffering has. Your shoes will compliment my essence which is to me only light and love.",,"Austin,  Texas",True

I realized that the entire time I was looking for the light, I was light the whole time.  I AM the light. I AM fully dedicated to my solar sales and I AM literally out there ""lighting my own path"" feet to the street.  To be honest if chosen and practical I would live these for my entire team.  Or the ones who are on board.  I wouldn't force them.  To finish these are super dope and I would represent by literally being out letting my own path teaching others how to light their own path with these on my feet beating the street in the solar industry.... ooouuu no one can stop me!!!

But with the encouragement of my sister, mom and dad(rest in peace) I lighted my own path. Before my injury I worked at a news station and did PA worked for independent films as well as photo shoots. After the injury I thought I was done. I leaned in to the idea of being disabled and not being able to do anything. However, with the encouragement of my family I debunked that thought of thinking. Realizing the old cliché that the only thing thing that can stop me is me. After the injury I produced two short films with one getting accepted to the Austin Film Festival. I was  brought on as a producer for a documentary film. I produced three commercials. And now I’m morning with an industrial company creating videos for their companies. As well as, independently producing an award winning talk show. So, yeah, I believe I lit my own path. Injuries can’t stop you.

I have no moved into pro weight classes, since I feel I'm ready to take another big step into my armwrestling journey. I am part of the West Texas Armsports team, located here in El Paso TX. I train with professionals and amateurs alike. I'm training hard for the next tournament on my city or around it. Im also a small business owner, I design and print 3D items, items vary from toys, art, utilities and I also do custom 3D prints. I've only been at it for about a year, but I believe in the vision of having many printers working side by side sending out orders and I also believe in my journal in armwrestling to be one of the very best at 154lbs to ever do it in the city of El Paso and in the state of Texas. Hopefully with enough hard training to even be mentioned with the greats of the sport. Thank you!",,El Paso,True

vbejarano3@yahoo.com,Vanessa Alcoser,"I cannot contribute my inspiration to just one single person or situation from my current lifetime, but rather from a cluster of people and experiences I have had.
I am a first generation Mexican-American, born to Native Mexican parents who were teens at the time and left to fend for themselves as their parents were disappointed in them for having a second child at such a young age. My father had a steady income and my mother could not remain at one job too long because she was not a citizen and her employers would soon begin asking for her proof of citizenship. Being teenage parents, all they could afford was to rent a two bedroom home in a neighborhood that was rampant with gang violence and drugs. To keep us from joining a gang, my parents kept my brother and I in sports at the local recreational park. I began playing T-ball when I was 5 years old and from there played a variety of other sports up until high school. Knowing that my parents did this for my siblings and I makes me admire them that much more because it shows their dedication to us and that they cared about what we became even though they worked most of the day. My mother earned her citizenship when I was in middle school and shortly thereafter she opened her own daycare business. A few years later, My father opened up his own machine tool shop and it was at this point that I decided that although every business has its ups and downs, I was inspired to be my own boss one day.
After I graduated high school, I told my parents that I would just attend a community college but they were against this and encouraged me to attend a University instead as they had always stated that they would like their children to become something better than they had the chance to become. Six years later (2014) after switching majors, I became the first female in my immediate and extended family to graduate with her Bachelor's degree. After this, I decided to build my work experience and are currently working for a Non-profit agency assisting adults with Developmental Disabilities live as independent as possible.
In the beginning of 2019, I decided to pursue my Master's degree in Marriage & Family Therapy. Towards the end of the first year, my husband and I decided that we wanted to start our own family but soon discovered that we would not be able to conceive naturally and were told that In-Vitro Fertilization would be the only way. This news broke us. After we were told the cost, risks, and the percentage of a successful outcome, it seemed like something impossible for us. I also had to make the choice of whether to pay for my second and final year to complete my Master's or pay for IVF. I decided on the latter and withdrew from University. 
Today, I have two beautiful boys (fraternal twins) who just turned 1 in July and I do not for a second regret my choice! I would do anything for my littles! My husband and little ones are now my inspiration to continue doing better. And so, I have reapplied for school and will begin working on completing my Master's in the Fall. Upon completion of my degree next year, I will then be the first person in my entire family to receive a Master's degree!",,"Torrance, CA",True

Creatively i also love to stand out from the rest, not for the attention, but rather for myself! Because at the end of the day, the more true you stay to your yourself and express yourself, you are being the best version of yourself and will attract others who are being their best! 

Wholesome words aside, my inspiration stems from my car. I have always been into cars and driving is my favourite passtime. I have always gone to meets and shows and appreciated all the cars and builds regardless of what they are, but at times most people could have the same parts and same kit for a build and can get common. I always do things my way and love standing out, things that are super unorthodox but are also great as an end result.

These shoes give me that feeling of really standing out from others and a huge sense of creativity as well! On top of that they look extremely comfortable and an all around fantastic pair of shoes!",,Calgary,False

z3r0jr.fr@gmail.com,Fernando Rodriguez Jr,"My son encourages me. My wife and I had been trying to get pregnant for a while, one day my wife surprised me with a positive pregnancy test. We went through a bunch of emotions, we were scared, we were happy, we cried. One day about two, maybe three weeks in, she wasn’t feeling good and well we lost the baby. It hit us hard, we went through a rough patch. But about a little over a month she said she wasn’t feeling good want went to the Doctor. We were congratulated with a positive pregnancy test. But we didn’t celebrate this time, e we took it very slow and cautious. Fast forward to our first ultrasound, and the expected delivery date didn’t add up. Well we explained to the doctor our little confusion. And he was confused as well. So started he started asking us questions, and we told him of the miscarriage. Well making a long story short, we never miscarried. Our little baby, my son never gave up. He got creative some how some way so he can hang on. And now we have super healthy 3 month old. So I’m asked what inspires me, my son. How do I light my path? I don’t, he does, I push forward for him, I keep going and I perfect my craft for him. He found a way to make it into our lives and for us to be his parents, well the least I can do is show him that his father never settles either. His father will always light his path just as he has for me.",,Chicago,False

sammuelnewton05@gmail.com,Saulz,"Photography, music, looking at other people's creations and the natural beauty that this world has to offer draws inspiration of my creativity for me. What I do is draw, take pictures and write lyrics. I believe to 'Light Your Own Path' you must set candles in line with the goals. imagine a dark maze with turns in every direction and the candles all scattered in the maze we call ""life"". You light your path be completing your goals, everytime you complete a goal, one candle is set to shine and the maze grows brighter and so you must take on new 
experiences and challenges, you must take on the darkness and make the challenges into experiences too. You slowly light the goals to a flame as recognition of success and you slowly begin to make your path as you complete those goals and explore new experiences in the maze while making your own path along the way. You set the work ahead of you and you learn about the path you are igniting by going through the maze and completing the goals. There was a man named Francis Bacon he was a English philosopher I remember being told by my 8th grade English teacher about him. He once said ""In order for the light to shine so brightly the darkness must be present"" the challenges lie ahead for you to discover.
